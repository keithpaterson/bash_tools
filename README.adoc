= Bash tools

Some simple tools that I find handy for writing bash scripts

== colors.sh

Provides some useful colorizing functions that make it easy to
decorate your script output.

Include this into your scripts with `source <path/to/colors.sh>`

Refer to the `colors.sh` file for more detailed explanation and examples.

== menu_engine/

Provides a simple mechanism for accessing subscripts by category which
will auto-generate some help/usage output and run your functions in a
controller manner via an intuitive command-line

Include this into your scripts with `source <path/to/menu_engine.sh>`

* You can control where your subscripts are found by setting the value of
  `ME_CATEGORY_DIR`.
* Subscript file names must start with an underscore.

Refer to the `menu_engine.sh` file for more detail

To see this in action, run `test.sh`
